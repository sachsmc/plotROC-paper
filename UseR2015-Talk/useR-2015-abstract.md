# Interactive Graphics with ggplot2 and gridSVG

Interactive statistical graphics can be useful in data analysis and reporting. They allow supplemental information to be displayed along with a standard chart, without diluting the main message. The package ggplot2 provides a powerful interface for creating high quality statistical graphics, while gridSVG converts grid graphics objects to svg objects that can be rendered in web browsers. We combine the two, along with a bit of JavaScript, to create interactive statistical graphics for use on the web. The idea is illustrated with examples for plotting receiver operating characteristic curves, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves, with interactive features bound to hover and click events. This approach differs from many others in that the figure rendering is handled by R, instead of a JavaScript library. JavaScript is used instead to bind interactive events to the svg objects. Our interface is based on the main strengths of R: the statistical computations and graphics rendering allowing for seamless transitions between static and interactive plots, retaining the R/ggplot2 style and allowing visual consistency across document types.
